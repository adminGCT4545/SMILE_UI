### System Architecture Overview

The Kynsey AI integration follows a client-server architecture:
- **Frontend**: Built using React and integrated into the ERP dashboard
- **Backend**: Node.js server handling API requests and processing chat commands
- **Database**: Stores user data, documents, and system configurations

### API Endpoints and Their Purposes

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/api/search` | GET | Searches for documents within the ERP system |
| `/api/email` | POST | Sends an email to specified recipients |
| `/api/document` | GET | Retrieves specific documents |

### Integration Points with the ERP System

The Kynsey AI chat integrates with various ERP modules:
- **Document Management**: Allows searching and retrieving documents
- **Email Handling**: Facilitates sending emails directly from the chat interface
- **Search API**: Enables querying data across different ERP systems

### Configuration Options

Configuration options are managed via environment variables in `.env` files located in both frontend and backend directories.

**Frontend .env**
```
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

**Backend .env**
```
PORT=3001
DATABASE_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/erp
```

### Performance Considerations

- **Caching**: Implement caching strategies to reduce database load
- **Load Balancing**: Use load balancers for high traffic scenarios
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to prevent API abuse
- **Connection Pooling**: Use connection pools for database operations
